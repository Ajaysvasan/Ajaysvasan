### 🕵️‍♂️ **Deepfake Detection System**  
> _Combating synthetic media with intelligence._  
Designed a **real-time deepfake detection system** using **CNNs with attention mechanisms**. This model effectively identifies manipulated media and helps tackle misinformation, fake news, and visual forgery.

### 🎥 **Smart Security Camera Prototype**  
> _AI-powered surveillance with object detection._  
Developed a **real-time object detection camera system** using **YOLOv5 and OpenCV**, capable of identifying suspicious movements and generating alerts — promoting intelligent monitoring and enhanced security automation.

### 💬 **Medical Chatbot (NLP + Transformers)**  
> _AI conversational assistant for preliminary diagnosis._  
Built a **smart medical chatbot** powered by **NLP and Transformer models** to assist users with **symptom-based health inquiries**. The system aims to improve early diagnosis accessibility through natural, user-friendly interaction.

### ❤️ **Heart Disease Prediction System (ML)**  
> _Predictive analytics for better healthcare decisions._  
Created a **Random Forest-based diagnostic model** that analyzes patient data to predict the likelihood of heart disease. It supports healthcare professionals in proactive, data-driven medical decision-making.

### 📚 **Student Database Management System (C++)**  
> _Learning by doing — building from scratch._  
A robust **menu-driven student database system**, developed entirely in **C++ using doubly linked lists** — intentionally designed **without SQL**, to explore **core data structure concepts, memory handling, and OOP principles**. This project was a hands-on approach to mastering low-level system logic.
