👋 Hey there, I’m Ajay S Vasan
🚀 AI/ML Developer | 🧠 Deep Learning Enthusiast | 💻 Competitive Programmer

💡 About Me
I’m an aspiring AI/ML Engineer currently pursuing my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (2023–2027) at St. Joseph’s College of Engineering. My passion lies in building impactful AI solutions that solve real-world problems across healthcare, automation, security, and computer vision.

I strive to design intelligent systems that are not only accurate but also efficient, scalable, and optimized for real-world deployment.

🔍 Areas of Expertise:
🧠 Deep Learning & Neural Network Architectures

♻️ Reinforcement Learning & AI Optimization

🎨 Generative Models (GANs, Diffusion Models)

⚡ High-Performance AI Systems & Inference Acceleration

🔬 Featured Projects
🕵️ Deepfake Detection System
Developed a real-time AI system to detect synthetic media using a CNN architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms. This model helps combat misinformation and visual manipulation by identifying forged content with high accuracy.

📹 Security Camera Prototype with Object Detection
A smart surveillance solution integrating real-time object detection using YOLO and OpenCV. Designed to detect and alert about suspicious activity, this prototype emphasizes safety, automation, and intelligent threat monitoring.

💬 Medical Chatbot
A conversational AI system powered by NLP and Transformer models, built to provide preliminary health diagnosis and medical assistance. Designed to assist patients in identifying symptoms and recommending further steps.

❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System
Built using Random Forest classifiers on structured clinical data, this project aims to predict heart disease risks at early stages, supporting doctors with data-driven decision-making tools.

📚 Student Database Management System (C++ Project)
A lightweight, menu-driven student database built entirely in C++ using doubly linked lists instead of SQL. This was a hands-on learning project to master data structures and understand internal memory handling without using databases.
